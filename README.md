# The Ender 5 Plus Ultimate Upgrade

## Purpose

I recently bought an [Ender 5 Plus](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/creality-ender-5-plus-3d-printer). I knew that, out-of-the-box, it wasn't the right printer for me but I couldn't find any printer that _was_ the right printer (for me for any price). So, I decided to buy the Ender 5 Plus and think of it as basis rather than finished product and upgrade it to what I actually wanted. I plan on documenting my journey in this repo.

## FAQ

### Why are you using GitHub for this?

While GitHub is tradtionally used for software, it actually is just a great platform for working in the public. Here are a few motivations:

* I use GitHub daily in my professional life, so it's very natural for me.
* Issues are a really good way frame problems, accept feedback, and track solutions.
* The Projects feature is something that I've recently fallen in love with and I want to use it more.
* I prefer to use markdown over HTML or any type of WYSIWYG editors (Google Docs, etc.)
* It's free and public with zero upkeep overhead.

### Why not [insert kit printer]?

I talked to some folks who have built kit printers and, frankly, I don't have the time nor patience for those. In general, it seems like those are aimed at people who want to build the printer as a hobby itself. That's not my goal. I like designing things and printing them but I want a printer that suits my needs. 

Additionally, I wanted a working printer along the way. My upgrades should give me a working, but maybe not ideal printer, while parts arrive and I find the time to make the upgrades or changes.
